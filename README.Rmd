'Dehex', from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dehex):

> To remove a hex (a spell, especially an evil spell).

An R package containing simple functions to help me train myself to 'read' a colour from its hex code. I'm colourblind (a deuteranope) so this might be a useful skill. [Read the accompanying blog post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/08/10/dehex/) for more info.

## The DeSandro method

[David DeSandro gave a talk at dotCSS 2018](https://metafizzy.co/blog/read-color-hex-codes/) about 'reading' colour hex codes by eye to get a colour like 'dark saturated orange' ([thanks Maëlle](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon/status/1420726230194794496?s=20)).

There are five steps:

1. Simplify from a six- to a three-digit hex code
1. Create an RGB bar chart from the short hex code
1. Assess hue from the chart 'shape'
1. Assess saturation from the RGB range
1. Assess lightness from the RGB total

This package contains functions that guide you through that process and can 'solve' the hex code for you.

## Install

You can install the development version from GitHub.
 
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/dehex")
```

## Three-digit shorthand

First, convert a full six-character hex code to its three-character shortcode. This takes the first value from each pair of characters.

```{r ex-shorten}
long <- "#6BCFFA"
short <- dehex::dh_shorten(long)
short
```

You could also generate a random one with `dh_random()`.

## Bar chart

Use `dh_graph()` to print to the console a bar chart that shows the decimal values of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) for your shortened hex code. 

```{r ex-graph}
dehex::dh_graph(short)
```

The RGB columns are printed in colour in RStudio, thanks to [the {crayon} package](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon). (You can turn this off by setting the argument `crayon = FALSE`.)

<div class="figure">
<img src="man/figures/graph-crayon-dark.png" alt="Output from the dehex package's dh_graph function, which shows a horizontal bar chart in the RStudio console with a dark theme. The columns are labelled R, G, B, S and L and the ends of the RGB columns are labelled H1, H2 and H3. The RGB bars are coloured red, blue and green; S and L are white. Above the plot is the three-digit colour hex code that graph is summarising." width="250px"/>
</div>

Note that the chart is adorned by extra information that tells you something about the hue (H, i.e. the relative 'rank' of each RGB channel), saturation (S, i.e. the RGB range) and lightness (L, i.e. the RGB average). You can remove these guides by setting the `adorn_*` arguments to `FALSE`.

The idea is to compare this to a set of guides that provide rough categorisations of hue, saturation and lightness to generate an English phrase.

## Guides

### Hue from shape

To assess the hue of your hex code, compare its RGB profile from `dh_graph()` to the guide provided by `dh_guide("H")`. The exact amounts don't matter; it's the relative values of RGB that we care about. For this reason, the end of each bar shows you the relative `rank()` of each channel (the smallest value is ranked '1', a tie between the two smallest gives them both a rank of '1.5', etc).

Well, technically my ranking system here has a wider tolerance for ties. So RGB values of 15, 6, and 5 will result in a tie between green and blue because their difference is below a certain threshold (2, but subject to testing).

```{r ex-hue}
dehex::dh_guide("H")
```
</details>

### Saturation from range

To assess the saturation of your hex code, compare its RGB profile from `dh_graph()` to the guide provided by `dh_guide("S")`. A larger RGB range means a more saturated colour.

```{r ex-sat}
dehex::dh_guide("S")
```

### Lightness from total

To assess the lightness of your hex code, compare its RGB profile from `dh_graph()` to the guide provided by `dh_guide("L")`. A higher total RGB means it's lighter in colour, but I've chosen to show the mean value as a guide.

```{r ex-light}
dehex::dh_guide("L")
```
</details>

## The solution

Luckily, `dh_solve()` returns the 'answer' for your colour as a text string. So, for our input `r short`, the 'answer' is:

```{r ex-solve}
dehex::dh_solve(short)
```

Of course, you could just use this function to get a simple way of communicating colour from hex codes without learning how to do it by 'reading' a hex code yourself.

You can also ask to return the relevant bar charts that best describe the hue, saturation and lightness that led to the result.

```{r ex-solve2}
dehex::dh_solve(short, graphs = TRUE)
```

And if you're wondering what the colour actually is, you can either set `swatch = TRUE` in `dh_solve()`, or use `dh_swatch()` to generate a plot filled with that colour.

```{r ex-swatch, out.width="100px", out.height="100px", fig.alt="A square of colour with its three-digit hex colour code in text in the centre."}
dehex::dh_swatch(short)
```
